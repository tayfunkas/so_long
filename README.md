# so_long

so_long is a simple 2D game project developed as part of the 42 programming school curriculum. This project involves creating a small top-down or side-view game using the MiniLibX graphics library. The player's goal is to collect all items on a map and reach the exit while avoiding obstacles.

## Key Learnings
- Custom map parsing from .ber files
- Player movement using W, A, S, D keys
- Collectible items and exit point
- Simple graphics using sprites and textures
- Move counter displayed in the shell

## Learning Objectives
- Basics of game development in C
- Working with a simple graphics library (MiniLibX)
- Efficient map parsing and validation
- Event handling in a graphical environment
- Implementing collision detection
- Managing game states and win conditions

## Usage
1. Compile the project with `make` command.
2. Run the game `./so_long maps/map.ber` or try other maps like map2,3,4,5, mapcomplex, mapmore, maplarge. 
3. Use arrow keys to move the player.
4. Collect all the seaweed to revive the green fish.
